# The Smoothest Web3 Experience: Introducing UXLINK Account Demo

## Overview
`UXLINK Account` is an innovative project designed to offer users a new way to manage digital assets. The main feature of this demo is generating a UXLINK Account based on social accounts or externally owned accounts (EOA) wallets.

With `UXLINK Account`, users can pay all transaction gas fees using `UXLINK Token`. This feature greatly simplifies the user's blockchain operations, enhancing the user experience.

UXLINK Account will also enable cross-chain functionality, allowing users to conduct transactions on all chains with just one `UXLINK Account` and a `UXLINK Token` balance. This design aims to provide a more efficient and convenient digital asset management experience.

## Implementation Concept
Our core concept is: `One Account, One Gas`. This emphasizes that users need only one account and one type of token—UXLINK—to transact across multiple chains. This simplified operation makes blockchain transactions easier and lowers the barrier for users.
